The Fash functions do rapid hashing and random number generation with
multiplication.

This package contains six program files:

    fash.h              A C header file
    uint64.h            Typedef include for uint64
    fash.c              An implementation in portable C
    fash64.x64.asm      A fast implementation of fash64 in assembly language
    fash256.x64.asm     A fast implementation of fash256 in assembly language
    rash64.x64.asm      A fast implementation of rash64 in assembly language
    srash64.x64.asm     A fast implementation of srash64 in assembly language

This package also contains descriptions of the functions:

    fash64.html         Practical hashing
    fash256.html        Secure hashing
    rash64.html         Practical random numbers
    srash64.html        Secure random numbers
